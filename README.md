# Deleting Your Facebook Data

There are [two different ways](http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-delete-facebook-account-2950145) to get your Facebook account offline. The first is *deactivating*, which means:

* You can reactivate your account whenever you want
* People can’t see your Facebook Timeline, or search for you
* Some information may remain visible (like messages you’ve sent)
* Facebook saves your account info (like friends and interests) in case you reactivate

But *deleting* your account is a much more serious matter. If you delete your account:

* Facebook delays deletion for a few days after the request is made. If you log in during the grace period, the deletion is cancelled
* You can’t regain access to your Facebook account once it’s deleted
* It can take up to 90 days for your data that’s stored in backup systems to be deleted. However, your info isn’t accessible on Facebook during this time
* Some things aren’t stored in your account, like messages that you’ve sent to friends – these will remain active
* Copies of some material (like log records) may remain in Facebook’s database, but are “disassociated from personal identifiers,” according to the company

Basically, deactivating is a way to cool off from Facebook for a while, while deleting is a permanent solution that you should think carefully about before choosing.

## How to Deactivate Your Facebook Account

To deactivate your Facebook account, follow these four steps:

1. Click the account menu down arrow 🔽 at the top right of any Facebook page in your web browser.
2. Select 'Settings'.
3. Choose 'Security' in the left column.
4. Choose 'Deactivate your account', and then follow the steps to confirm your decision.

To reactivate your account after deactivating it, simply log into Facebook your e-mail and password. Your profile will be entirely reinstated.

## How to Delete Your Facebook Account

Deleting your Facebook account is a serious decision, so make sure it’s something you really want to do. Whether you like it or not, social media is ingrained in society, and your Facebook profile can affect friendships, job prospects, and social opportunities. Remember that there are also ways to secure your [Facebook privacy settings](http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/facebook-privacy-settings-protecting-what-you-care-about-2939307), if that’s your particular concern.

Plus, you may miss out on some 'dank memes' by deleting Facebook, and however grating it is in places, it’s also useful for plenty of things, such as keeping up with friends from abroad and organizing events.

If you’re set on binning the social network off for good, click the following link and choose the 'Delete my account' option:

Before deleting your account, you'll probably want to keep a backup of your Facebook data. To do this, follow these steps:

You can download your information from your Facebook settings. To download your information:

1. Click 🔽 at the top right of any Facebook page and select ['Settings'](https://www.facebook.com/settings).
2. Click '**Download a copy** of your Facebook data' at the bottom of 'General Account Settings'.
3. Click 'Start My Archive'.
4. You'll get an email when the archive is ready for you to download.
5. Just click on the link in the email and download. Done!

Because this download contains your profile information, you should keep it secure and be careful when storing, sending, or uploading it to any other services.
If you have any concerns, be sure to read our privacy policy, and get in touch if you have any questions.
